# Design and Test

The **Digital Rain** project is a C++ console-based animation that simulates falling digital rain, inspired by the "Matrix" effect. It integrates **synchronized music playback** with **randomized falling symbols**, giving the illusion that the raindrops are the notes being played.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Falling Effect** – Cascading numbers and symbols create a mesmerizing rain animation.
- **Synchronized Music** – The Super Mario Bros. theme plays in the background while raindrops "match" the beat.
- **Multi-Threaded Execution** – One thread controls the animation while another plays the music.
- **Prime-Based Spawning** – Raindrops are generated at prime-number-based intervals for a natural rhythm.
- **Randomized Colors & Speed** – Each raindrop has a unique speed and color for variety.

## System Components

### 1. RainDrop Class

Handles individual raindrop behavior, including:
- **Randomized position, length, and speed** for natural movement.
- **Color variation** to enhance the digital rain aesthetic.
- **Character selection** (numbers, special symbols, blocks).

### 2. DigitalRain Class

Manages the overall animation and screen updates:
- **Frame rate control (~30 FPS)** to maintain smooth performance.
- **Console buffer manipulation** for efficient rendering.
- **Multi-threading support** for concurrent music playback.
- **Memory management** to prevent performance degradation.

## Multi-Threading for Animation & Audio

The program runs **two concurrent threads**:

1. **Main Thread** – Controls falling rain animation.
2. **Music Thread** – Uses `PlaySound()` to loop the Super Mario theme WAV file.

The synchronization between falling symbols and background music makes it feel like the raindrops are playing the song.

## Testing

### 1. Visual Rendering Tests
Verified that raindrops:
- Spawn **randomly** and fall at **different speeds**.
- Maintain **consistent frame rates** (~30 FPS).
- Display **bright leading symbols** that fade towards the tail.

### 2. Performance Optimization
Ensured:
- **No memory leaks** by removing off-screen raindrops dynamically.
- **Stable console rendering** with smooth transitions.
- **Efficient execution** without high CPU usage.

### 3. Music Synchronization
Tested that:
- Raindrops **appear to "play" the Super Mario notes**.
- The **music thread runs independently** from the animation.
- The timing of raindrop spawns **feels natural with the rhythm**.

### 4. Console Compatibility
Ensured compatibility with:
- Different **console sizes**.
- Various **Windows configurations**.
- No **flickering or crashing** during execution.

## Final Outcome

The **Digital Rain** program successfully creates a **visually engaging and synchronized audio experience**. By integrating **console-based animation with music playback**, the project blends **technical complexity with artistic creativity**, resulting in a **stunning, interactive effect**.
